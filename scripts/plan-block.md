Canonical rule for the form a skill's plan takes on arrival. `scripts/gen-skills.ts` writes it
inside each such skill's `<skills-plan>` element; `pnpm skills:check` fails if a copy drifts. Edit
it here, never in a skill.

Everything below is self-contained on purpose: a skill can be installed on its own, so it must not
link to another skill or to a file at the repo root — name the other skill instead.

Which skills carry it is decided by **what a skill puts in front of a human**: any skill that
presents a plan, a preview, a candidate list or a findings report and then waits to be answered. A
skill whose whole output is a short acknowledgement has nothing that could arrive folded, and
carries nothing. The criterion decides; `test/isolation.test.ts` records the resulting roster and
asserts it against the tags on disk, because a skill that should carry the block and does not looks
exactly like one that should not.

## Presenting the plan

Everything this skill puts in front of a human — plan, preview, candidate list, findings report —
is read **once, in a terminal**, and answered there. So **every section of it renders on arrival**,
with no interaction needed to reveal it: prose, lists, tables, fenced code.

**Never fold content behind a control.** `<details>`/`<summary>` is a browser widget, and a
terminal has no way to open it: the summary line prints and everything under it does not. The plan
then arrives as headings with nothing beneath them, and the failure is silent on **both** sides —
the skill believes it reported, and the reader sees no marker saying anything is missing, so a
human confirms a plan whose contents never reached them. What gets folded is whatever ran long,
which is to say the part the decision actually rested on. The same holds for anything else needing
a click: a tab strip, an accordion, a "show more".

**Length is handled by shortening, never by hiding.** This is a fixed rule of the skill, not a
per-run judgement, so it holds however long the list runs. Trim to what the decision needs, group
the rest by something the reader already thinks in (ecosystem, kind, verdict) with a count per
group, or split it across sections. What is left out is left out **visibly**: say how many, why,
and the exact command that shows the rest.

**This binds what the skill presents, not what it writes.** A `<details>` block inside a README, an
issue body, a pull request description or a docs page is rendered by a browser and is entirely
legitimate there. The rule is about the message a human reads to decide — never about the content
of a file.
